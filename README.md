# 3 Digits Temperature Display
Purpose:  The purpose of this project is to use the Arduino as a CPU for a temperature sensor with a 3 digit display in C°.
•	A 3 digit seven segment display will be used .
•	The shift register from the previous lab will be used as connected with no changes except to use the decimal point.
•	We will use a temp sensor which goes from -40 to 125°C, the same is in TinkerCAD.
•	We will add to the circuit from the last lab by adding 3 transistors and 2 more displays to control the digits of the display.

# Circuit on Breadboard and Dispaly 'OFF/ON'

Display is 'On' with 3 digits
